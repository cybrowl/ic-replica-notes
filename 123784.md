## [2fc6b4c2e] Consensus: chore: Small improvements to CanisterHttpPayloadBuilder

Everything checks out. Although the structure of timer changed a bit overall nothing was added that looks concerning.

## [c3ba1b43e] Consensus: feat: Only sign hash of block in BlockProposals

Biggest changes is intro of `BlockMetadata`. Basic signature is now `BasicSignature<BlockMetadata>`

## [53cbc5963] Consensus: feat: Delay loading of block payload in ConsensusBlockChain

Looks like optimization work.

## [3669ea703] Crypto: feat: standalone basic and canister signatures verifier

This one has way too many changes to review in a reasonable time. However the lib looks good. It has many tests. Looks like it is mainly related to the new signature functions.

## [3261e4dc9] Crypto: feat: support for Keccak-256

All changes are related to Keccak-256. ic-crypto-sha3 dep is added.

## [98326a39e] Crypto: fix: add error handling to $witness_type::merge

Good amount of error checking which is great. Sets some limits to recursion for the tree so that it doesn't go on forever. Good additions.

## [eb9b29ecb] Crypto: fix: use non-random number of corrupted dealers in NI-DKG benchmarks

All changes are consistent with change, add check `.max_corrupt_dealers(get_faults_tolerated(test_case.num_of_dealers))`

## [7cf96698e] Crypto: perf: improve performance of FlatMap::from_key_values()

All code related to improving flatmap.
